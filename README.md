# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe – Web-Based Game
A simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) game for two players, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a browser-based implementation where two users can play in turns on the same screen, with automatic win/draw detection.

🧠 How It Works
Players alternate clicking on the empty boxes to place their symbol (❌ or ⭕).

JavaScript logic checks for:

Three same symbols in a row/column/diagonal → Win

All boxes filled with no winner → Draw

The game ends when either condition is met, with an option to reset the game.
